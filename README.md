# Football API

A C# library for [Football-Data.org](https://www.football-data.org/documentation/api).

## Introduction

This library was first made for a Discord Bot but I decided to make a proper project and share it.

## How to use it

- Get the JSON library by restoring NuGet packages (in case you are not familiar with).
- See the sample project I included named **FootballAPIExample**.
- Create an account [here](https://www.football-data.org/client/register) to get an API token.
- API documentation - [Link](https://www.football-data.org/documentation/api).
